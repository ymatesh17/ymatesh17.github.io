			<p>I am an active individual. My hobbies are traveling, playing soccer, snowboarding, mountain biking, scuba diving, running, yoga, hiking, reading, and watching documentaries. I chose psychology because I believe learning about our inner world is as important as learning about our outer world. I have learned about the physiological, emotional, cognitive and social determinants of behavior and the current understanding of the various disciplines in psychology as well as major theories and history of psychology. I have experience with psychological research methods, including data collection and analysis; as well as knowledge of research ethics. Additional specific knowledge and abilities related to my major include Cognition, Neuroscience, Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Forensic Psychology.</p>
