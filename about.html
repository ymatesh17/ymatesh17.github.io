						<p> "<b>Two years ago</b> I bought the first fountain pen, and since then my passion for calligraphy motivated me for self-development. The journey was hard at first, there were so many failures(and tears to be honest) which required a lot of commitment and free time. However, I never stopped trying and it lead me to success. Consistency and pratice are the two main advices I give to people who want to become better at any sort of creative artwork. 
						<br><b>Nowadays</b> calligraphy and handcrafting are not only enjoyable and calming hobbies, but also my work. It has always been my dream to love what I do, and I can totally say that I'm living it." </p>
